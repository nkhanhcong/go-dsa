This is some my thoughts about solving problems

</h1>Algorithm</h1>

- **DFS** is one of algorithms to travel graph or tree from a start node. Helping you travel all possible node of start node
- **Method to implement**:

    - You can use 2 options to solve problems: iterative loop ( using with stack) and recursion

- **Type of problems can be solve**:

    - Finding connected components
    - Finding path from one node to another node 
    - Detecting cycles in a graph
    - Topological sort
